# TheWholeEnchilada

This backend queries roughly 10 million rows of data across 6 tables and serves even its larger queries consistently in < 25ms. <br/>
I built this project to thoroughly explore the creation of a server and database that can perform complex queries and serve relevant data to an existing E-commerce front end.<br/>
Throughout this process I have discovered so much about backend development. From using PostgreSQL and CSVs to Dockerizing and Deploying, this has been an invaluable learning experience. <br/>
